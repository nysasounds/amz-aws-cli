# Snap packaging of AWS CLI

Universal Command Line Interface for Amazon Web Services.

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to
manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download
and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from
the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features including improved
installers, new configuration options such as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO),
and various interactive features.
