  Universal Command Line Interface for Amazon Web Services
  The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to
  manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download
  and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from
  the command line and automate them through scripts.

  The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features including improved
  installers, new configuration options such as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO),
  and various interactive features. 

  For best user experience, create an alias for this snap to the standard upstream binary name.
  $ sudo snap alias amz-aws-cli aws

  If you are migrating from other packaging of AWS CLI, you may want to migrate your existing config.
  $ amz-aws-cli.setup

  If you find bash completion is not working, you can probably get it working by install the core snap.
  This seems to be a bug in the completion implementation.
  $ sudo snap install core
